    <p>This was my first project in which I had to create a website fully describing my favorite recipe.
        Along with it are tabs that open up to different html links within the directory. With this project
        I implemented HTML & CSS elements and combined them.

    </a>
    <p>This was a fun project I made using chat-gpt the whole way through. It created interesting features
        taught me new things and showed me different ways of working. I learned the power of Chat-gpt through this
        project.

         </a>
        <p>This project was the first time I implemented CSS into html. It's a simple project but it was me entering into a new world.
            and implementing new things. I put an image of Julius Caesar and showed the potential of using CSS and HTML together for the first time.
