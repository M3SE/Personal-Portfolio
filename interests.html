              <h3>The Gamer</h3>
              <p>Ever since I was a kid I was surrounded by video games and computers. The first game
                I got hooked onto was Garry's Mod way back in the day. It provided comfort and a chance to bond
                with others that shared the same interest. Sandbox games were always my favorite because it gave you
                the freedom to choose your own path and it helped me be creative as well as develop different
                perspectives.

              <h3>The Producer</h3>
              <p>I've always loved music and the comfort that it brought. Music has accompanied me through
                hard and great times. It helps bring my emotional feelings upfront in a healthy way and makes me feel
                understood. I love how well different elements can blend in together to make up something. They 
                help blend an idea that relates to you or makes you evoke a certain emotion about a certain song.
                I started producing as a way to share my inner feelings through sound.

              <h3>The Photographer</h3>
              <p>I'm passionate about capturing life's moments and beauty through photography. Moments in life come and go
                a picture and a video last forever. There is a certain art to photography and videography that can show more 
                then what you just see with the naked eye.
