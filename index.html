        <p class="facts">I was born in 2003 to a Hmong Family in Minnesota. My family had just moved from Laos after the 
        Vietnam War and started their
        new life in America.
        One thing that brought my family together
        and what we loved to do together was music.
        Together my father and his brothers created a group band called KLS. 
        They <b>debuted in 1989</b>
        They were one of the very first
        in America to start making noise for Hmong Music all across the world and to represent the potential
        in what Hmong Music could become. My cousins and I shortly after started our very own group with the KLS Production label. 
       <b>AllKnighters</b> was created in 2019!
